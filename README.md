# Waste Segregation Using CNN

This project focuses on building a CNN model to automatically classify images of common waste materials (cardboard, glass, paper, plastic, etc.). The goal is to improve waste management by enabling automated sorting, which can lead to higher recycling rates, reduced landfill waste, and lower operational costs compared to manual methods. Successful implementation promises applications in smart bins and waste processing plants, contributing to environmental sustainability.

## General Information

This assignment explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the task of automated waste classification. The dataset comprises images of seven common waste categories, including cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, food waste, and other. The primary goal is to train a CNN model capable of accurately identifying these waste types from images. Successful implementation aims to contribute to more efficient and sustainable waste management practices by enabling automated sorting and improving recycling rates.
## Business Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Develop a model for automated waste classification.

2. Reduce the labor and time associated with manual waste sorting.

3. Increase recycling rates through precise identification of recyclable materials.

4. Lower operational costs in waste management processes.

5. Improve the efficiency of waste segregation.
Contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing landfill waste.

6. Enhance the accuracy of waste classification compared to manual methods.
